           named "value" and it returns the "value" if nothing is wrong.
           However, if the "value" is null, it throws NullPointerException.
           If the "value" is a blank string, it throws IllegalArgumentException.
       1.3 Create a public method named "testPositive" in "Utilitor" class.
           This method receives a parameter of type "double" named "value"
           and it returns the "value" if this "value" is a positive value.
           Otherwise, it throws IllegalArgumentException.
       1.4 Create a public method named "computeIsbn10" in "Utilitor" class.
           This method recieves a parameter of type "long" named "isbn10"
           and it returns the value of "isbn10" whose last digit is modified
           to make it a valid ISBN-10.
           See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_digit for ISBN-10 calculation.

           NullPointerException if the "owner" parameter is null.

           and then returns the new "balance".  However, this method will not
           do so if the new "balance" cannot pass "Utilitor.testPositive" method.
